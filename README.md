career and rent price ABM

Dear Githubbers

I decided to learn about agent based modelling and here is my first attempt!

The goal was to simulate how startups drive up rent prices in places, as seen in silicon valley and etc.
It starts with randomly located persons, with a few entrepreneurs. Here is a description of some basic rules:

    -- Entrepreneurs get paid proportional to number of employees
    -- Company limited to 11x11 square centered at entrepreneur
    -- Employees get paid more the closer to employer(entrepreneur)
    -- Employees change jobs if they don't think they can pay next yr's rent
    -- Employees can go bankrupt
    -- Rent price proportional to occupier's wealth

Please feel free to use this however you see fit!


Kind Regards,

Kunhee Lee
